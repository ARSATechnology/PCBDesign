ARSA Merah Series is our very first series we've ever designed back in 2017.
it consist of 3 different type of MCU Board

1. ARSA Mini

an Ultra-small MCU Board based on ATTiny85, it has a USB for programming & communication, and size only 2x2 cm

2. ARSA Merah W

Our very first MCU Board we designed, based on ATMega2560. it has a size of 5x5 cm

3. ARSA Merah W with USB

Same as ARSA Merah W, but in this design it is equiped with a USB to ttl connected to UART1


Thank you
